ShapeStack: Design 

Isabel Lindmae 
  I chose to create 4 classes; the main class, canvas, myRectangle, and myPolygon. Buttons and the creation of the canvas are in the main class. The canvas class holds the meat of the project and where it populates a canvas with all possible objects created on it. Mouse events are also built into the canvas class. As the mouse button is pressed, the object is moved into the position of the mouse and filled in. myPolygon is the parent class to myRectangle. I chose to do this because myRectangle uses similar methods. In myPolygon, a polygon object is created which can have a varied number of vertices and radii (that the user can adjust). In myRectangle, the number of vertices is locked to 4 and the radii canâ€™t be adjusted (as rectangles have width and length).
