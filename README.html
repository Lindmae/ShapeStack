ShapeStack: Read Me 

Isabel Lindmae 
compile the project by typing the following into terminal:
	javac ShapeStack.java
run the project by typing the following into terminal:
	java ShapeStack

	To operate the program:
		Click anywhere within the black square to spawn an object. An object will spawn based on the location of the mouse click (with that location becoming the center of the object). Initially, blue rectangles are spawned. Blue rectangles will check for collision with other rectangles and check for collisions with the bottom of the screen. Polygons/Tess circles will only check for collisions with the bottom of the screen or if the polygons/tess circles are stacked directly onto of each other (same x value). To change the shape, click the “Change shape” button found on the right side. If the button is pressed, the shape should change to a red polygon/tess circle with 8 vertices and a radius of 10 and the canvas should be cleared. You can continue to click the button to switch between the two shapes. Clicking the “+radius” button on the right will increase the radius of the polygons/tess circles (both polygons already on the canvas and future polygons) and clicking the “-radius button” will decrease their radius. You can also change the number of vertices, or tessellations, of the polygons by clicking “+sides” and “-sides” to increase or decrease respectively. Clicking the close button will exit the program. The program spawns a maximum of 15 objects, either polygons/tess circles or rectangles but not both. If 15 objects are already created and the user clicks again, the screen will be refreshed and become blank once more.
